to use redux toolkit, we must install redux

https://react-md.dev/packages/material-icons/demos

npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux axios
after the installation,
inside index.js, import  configureStore from @reduxjs/toolkit
and also import Provider from react-redux.

in our index.js we have imported most of files to work with 
after this, we will create a folder called features inside src folder and inside this folder,
we will create a file called cartSlice.js
After creating and adding some code in our cartSlice.js,
 npm i react-toastify
we will now import cartSlice from './features/cartSlice' in our index.js
